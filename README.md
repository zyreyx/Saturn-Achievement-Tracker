Hello! Welcome to Saturn Steam Achievement Tracker, I dont have much to add to this readme, however I should say that during the verification of your Steam ID your window may freeze and say "Not Responding"
this is just because the verification takes a while, its communicating with steams servers to verify your ID and retrieve data like your profile picture, games and display name.

please send any suggestions or bugs to @zyreey on discord, i'd also love to hear what you think about the app!

for fun, heres the first screenshot I took of this project

this is actually a screenshot of a screenshot lol

this project was 100% python, I started it because i'm a VERY new developer and I wanted to learn about apis and requests, along to way i learnt alot about guis, a bit about threading, improved my overall programming knowledge and had alot of fun!

at one point, I was first on the hakatime leaderboards for this project, with 7 hours or something around there, which is pretty cool.

anyway, thats all i have to say about this project, i hope you like it!
