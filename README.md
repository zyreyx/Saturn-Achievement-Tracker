## Hello! Welcome to Saturn Steam Achievement Tracker, I dont have much to add to this readme but heres a few cool things

<img width="602" height="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323641ee-9b0d-4606-a180-5f76df63f824" />

this is actually a screenshot of a screenshot lol

this project was 100% python, I started it because i'm a VERY new developer and I wanted to learn about apis and requests, along to way i learnt alot about guis, a bit about threading, improved my overall programming knowledge and had alot of fun!

at one point, I was first on the hakatime leaderboards for this project, with 7 hours or something around there, which is pretty cool.

anyway, thats all i have to say, i hope you like it!

# Features:

### Pop Ups

  There are 3 popups you may face:
  The api key popup - if you dont have an api key, or when changing settings,
  the steam id popup - if you dont have a steam id, or when changing settings,
  and the timezone popup - if you dont have a timezone, or when changing settings.

  each of these pieces of information is stored its its on text file locally on your machine. eg. (text files\steam_id.txt)
  
  
### Settings Menu

  The settings menu includes the ability to:
  Change your api key
  change your steam id
  change your timezone
  and refresh your achievements.

### The Achievements 

  When you load a game, a grid featuring all that games achievements will be loaded, the grid will contain the achievement icon, name and achieved state (yes or no),
  if you click the icon of any achievement another frame will load containing the previous information aswell as the description and time you achieved it in your selected 
  timezone (12 hr am/pm) if you have achieved it.

### The Back Button

  The back button in the top left corner of the screen will take you back to the previous frame you were on, the home frame containing the greeting screen does not have a back 
  button because theres nowhere to go back to, its pretty self explanatory lol.

### Extra Info

  If you dont see a game you have in your library, its likely because that game has no acheivements.
  All frames have the settings menu in the top right corner.
  The reason verifying your steam id takes so long is because its also fetching all your games and filtering them to see if they have any achievements, aswell as your display name 
  and profile picture.

please send any suggestions or bugs to @zyreyxr on discord, i'd also love to hear what you think about the program!

# Thank you for checking out the project! (:
